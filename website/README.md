#### Tic-Tac-Go, a simple original game, made using Javascript, HTMl, CSS:

Rules of this game:

* Players take turns placing stones on the board, in an empty space among the 8x8 grid of spaces

* Players score points equal to the number of 4-in-a-rows of their color, plus the number of *non-overlapping* 3-in-a-rows. (For a visualization of how the 3's are counted, try placing several stones and clicking the "Show three-connects" box)

* Players can not place their stone more than 2 squares orthogonally or diagonally from the stone their opponent just placed, unless there are no such spaces available. (If this rule is taking effect, the most recently placed stone will have a gold border)

* White (who moves second) has a 1.5 point handicap
